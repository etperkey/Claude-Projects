GCB-DLBCL: MOLECULAR DETERMINANTS OF STAGE
Analysis Summary - Lacy/HMRN Dataset
================================================================================

OBJECTIVE:
Identify genomic and transcriptional features that distinguish Limited (Stage I-II)
from Advanced (Stage III-IV) GCB-DLBCL.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DATASET OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Source: Lacy/HMRN (GSE181063)
Platform: Illumina HumanHT-12 WG-DASL V4.0

GCB Patients with Staging:
  - Total GCB: 516
  - Limited stage (I-II): 136
  - Advanced stage (III-IV): 209
  - Excluded (intermediate/unknown): 171

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GENOMIC ANALYSIS RESULTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

STATUS: Could not be completed

REASON: No overlap between GCB expression data (516 patients) and mutation
data (928 patients) in the Lacy/HMRN dataset. The expression and sequencing
cohorts are largely non-overlapping.

ALTERNATIVE: The Reddy/Duke dataset has both mutations and staging data
and could be used for genomic stage determinant analysis.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANNOTATED GENES OF INTEREST
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SIGNIFICANT (FDR < 0.1):

1. FOXO1 - Higher in Limited Stage (FDR = 0.077)
   - Transcription factor regulating S1PR2 expression
   - FOXO1 promotes GC retention via S1PR2 upregulation
   - Higher FOXO1 in early disease suggests stronger retention signaling
   - Biological implication: Early-stage GCB may have more intact
     retention mechanisms keeping cells in lymph nodes

2. PAX5 - Higher in Limited Stage (FDR = 0.087)
   - Master B-cell transcription factor
   - Essential for B-cell identity and differentiation
   - Higher in early disease suggests more differentiated phenotype

3. MS4A1 (CD20) - Higher in Limited Stage (FDR = 0.087)
   - B-cell surface marker targeted by rituximab
   - Higher expression in early disease
   - May indicate more mature B-cell phenotype

TRENDING (p < 0.05, FDR > 0.1):

4. MYC - Higher in Advanced Stage (p = 0.04)
   - Oncogenic transcription factor
   - Associated with proliferation and aggressive disease
   - Higher in advanced disease suggests more aggressive phenotype

EGRESS PATHWAY GENES (NOT SIGNIFICANT):

Gene        Direction    p-value   Note
--------    ----------  --------   ----
S1PR2       Limited      0.68      Retention signal receptor
GNA13       Advanced     0.67      Retention signal mediator
RHOA        Advanced     0.18      Retention signal effector
CXCR4       Limited      0.50      Egress signal receptor
SGK1        Advanced     0.46      Egress signal (FOXO1 regulator)
GNAI2       Advanced     0.75      Egress signal mediator
ARHGEF1     Limited      0.11      Retention signal
P2RY8       Limited      0.60      Retention signal

=> The egress/retention pathway genes themselves do NOT differ by stage,
   but their upstream regulator FOXO1 DOES (higher in Limited stage).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KEY BIOLOGICAL INSIGHTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. TRANSCRIPTIONAL PROFILE DISTINGUISHES STAGE

   Advanced-stage GCB-DLBCL shows:
   - More proliferative signature (MYC trend)
   - Less mature B-cell phenotype (lower PAX5, CD20)
   - Lower FOXO1 (reduced retention signaling)

   Limited-stage GCB-DLBCL shows:
   - Higher B-cell differentiation markers
   - Higher FOXO1 (enhanced retention signaling)
   - More nodal-restricted phenotype

2. FOXO1 AS POTENTIAL STAGE DETERMINANT

   FOXO1 transcriptionally activates S1PR2, the key receptor that keeps
   B cells in the germinal center. Higher FOXO1 in Limited stage suggests
   that retention signaling is better preserved, potentially explaining
   why disease remains localized.

   SGK1 (when active) phosphorylates and inhibits FOXO1, promoting egress.
   The SGK1 level doesn't differ by stage, but FOXO1 does.

3. EGRESS PATHWAY GENES: MUTATIONS VS EXPRESSION

   While egress pathway mutations (GNA13, RHOA, etc.) are common in GCB,
   the expression of these genes does NOT predict stage. The functional
   consequence of mutations (loss-of-function) may not be reflected in
   mRNA levels.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. FOXO1 as Biomarker:
   - FOXO1 expression may help predict disease extent
   - Could be validated as prognostic marker

2. Therapeutic Considerations:
   - FTY720 (fingolimod) targets S1PR1-mediated egress
   - May be most relevant for Advanced-stage (low FOXO1) patients
   - Limited-stage with high FOXO1 may already have strong retention

3. B-cell Differentiation State:
   - Advanced-stage shows less differentiated phenotype
   - May impact rituximab response (CD20 lower)

LIMITATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Probe annotation incomplete - only ~15 of 96 significant probes annotated
   Full annotation requires R/Bioconductor illuminaHumanv4.db package

2. Genomic analysis blocked by data structure
   Expression and mutation data don't overlap in this dataset

3. Validation needed in independent cohort

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

Transcriptional analysis of GCB-DLBCL identified 96 probes (FDR < 0.1) that
distinguish Limited from Advanced stage disease. The key finding is that
FOXO1, a transcription factor that promotes GC retention via S1PR2, is
significantly higher in Limited stage GCB-DLBCL. This provides a potential
molecular explanation for why some GCB-DLBCL remains localized while other
cases disseminate.

The egress pathway genes themselves (S1PR2, GNA13, CXCR4, etc.) do not differ
by stage at the expression level, suggesting that functional mutations rather
than expression changes drive the retention/egress imbalance in GCB-DLBCL.
