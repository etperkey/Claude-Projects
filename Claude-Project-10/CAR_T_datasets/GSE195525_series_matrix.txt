!Series_summary	"To investigate whether metoprolol treatment could affect immune cells population and proinflammatory gene expression in  bone marrow mononuclear cells from CAR-T therapy received DLBCL patient"
!Series_overall_design	"Mononuclear cells were isolated before and after metoprolol treatmetn from bone marrow of CAR-T therapy received DLBCL patient by Ficoll gradients, and isolated cells were frozen for preservation and sent out for scRNA-seq library construction by using 10x genomics platform."

Specifically, splicing-aware aligner STAR was used in FASTQs alignment. Cell barcodes were then determined based on distribution of UMI count automatically. Finally, gene-barcode matrix for sample were generated for downstream analysis."
