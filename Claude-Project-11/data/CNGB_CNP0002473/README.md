## Study Details
This dataset is part of the study "Molecular landscape of distinct follicular lymphoma histologic grades: insights from genomic and transcriptome analyses" (Leukemia 2025).

### Key Findings from Transcriptomics
- Immune-related pathway activity decreases with increasing grade
- Metabolic and cell cycle pathway activity increases with grade
- Distinct pathway activation patterns by FL subtype
- Integration with WES reveals genotype-phenotype correlations
