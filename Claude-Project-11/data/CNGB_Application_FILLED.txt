SECTION II: PROJECT INFORMATION
============================================================

A. PROJECT TITLE
------------------------------------------------------------
>>> Integrated Genomic and Transcriptomic Analysis of Follicular
    Lymphoma for Identification of Prognostic Biomarkers and
    Therapeutic Targets

B. DATA REQUIREMENT
------------------------------------------------------------
CNSA Project IDs:
>>> CNP0002472 (Whole Exome Sequencing data)
>>> CNP0002473 (RNA-seq Transcriptome data)

Statement of needs:
>>> We require access to the whole exome sequencing (WES) data from
    149 follicular lymphoma patients and matched RNA-seq transcriptome
    data from 63 patients to conduct integrated multi-omics analysis.
    This dataset uniquely provides paired genomic and transcriptomic
    data across FL histologic grades (FL1-2, FL3A, FL3B), enabling
    investigation of genotype-phenotype relationships in FL progression.

C. LAY SUMMARY OF THE PROJECT (Research Purpose, Plan, Cycle)
------------------------------------------------------------
>>> Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the most common indolent B-cell
    non-Hodgkin lymphoma, affecting approximately 15,000 new patients
    annually in the United States alone. Despite advances in treatment,
    clinical outcomes remain highly variable, with some patients
    experiencing early progression or transformation to aggressive
    disease. Current prognostic tools (FLIPI, m7-FLIPI) have limited
    precision in predicting individual patient outcomes.

    RESEARCH PURPOSE:
    This project aims to identify molecular biomarkers that predict
    clinical outcomes in FL by integrating whole exome sequencing
    with transcriptomic profiling. Specifically, we will:

    1. Characterize the mutational landscape across FL histologic
       grades to identify grade-specific driver mutations
    2. Correlate somatic mutations with gene expression programs
       to understand functional consequences of genomic alterations
    3. Develop integrated genomic-transcriptomic signatures that
       predict disease progression and transformation risk
    4. Validate findings against publicly available FL cohorts
       (GSE119214, GSE16131) with clinical outcome data

    RESEARCH PLAN:
    Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Data preprocessing, quality control, and
    harmonization of WES and RNA-seq data
    Phase 2 (Months 4-6): Mutation calling, variant annotation, and
    differential expression analysis by histologic grade
    Phase 3 (Months 7-9): Integration of genomic and transcriptomic
    data using multi-omics analytical frameworks
    Phase 4 (Months 10-12): Biomarker development, validation, and
    manuscript preparation

    RESEARCH CYCLE: 12 months

D. LAY DATA UTILIZATION PLAN
------------------------------------------------------------
How CNGBdb Controlled Data will be used:
>>> The WES data will be processed through established somatic mutation
    calling pipelines (Mutect2, Strelka2) to identify single nucleotide
    variants and indels. Mutation frequencies will be compared across
    FL grades. The RNA-seq data will undergo differential expression
    analysis (DESeq2) and pathway enrichment (GSEA) to identify
    transcriptional programs associated with each grade. Integration
    will be performed using Multi-Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA) and
    correlation networks to link mutations with expression changes.

Cloud computing plan:
>>> Data will be stored and analyzed on institutional high-performance
    computing clusters with appropriate security controls. No external
    cloud services will be used for raw data storage. If cloud computing
    becomes necessary, we will use approved institutional cloud
    resources with encryption and access controls.

Data management after project completion:
>>> Upon project completion, all raw sequencing data will be securely
    deleted from our systems. Only derived summary statistics,
    aggregated results, and publication-ready figures will be retained.
    A data destruction certificate will be provided to CNGBdb upon request.

Submit output data to CNGBdb:
>>> [X] YES
    (We agree to deposit any novel processed datasets or signatures
    derived from this analysis back to CNGBdb for community benefit)

E. BACKGROUND OF PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR/INSTITUTION
------------------------------------------------------------
>>> [YOUR INSTITUTION] is a [research university/medical center] with
    extensive experience in cancer genomics research. The institution
    maintains secure computing infrastructure compliant with data
    protection requirements, including encrypted storage, access logging,
    and regular security audits.
