## KEY FINDING 1: Treatment Response Strongly Predicts Survival

### Discovery (Duke, n=901)
**Complete response to initial therapy is the strongest predictor of overall survival**

| Response | N | Events | Median OS |
|----------|---|--------|-----------|
| Complete Response | 744 | 159 | Not reached |
| Partial/No Response | 157 | 108 | 40.4 months |

**HR = 0.18 (95% CI: 0.14-0.23), p = 5.2e-42**

### Response Rate by Genetic Subtype

| Subtype | N | CR Rate |
|---------|---|---------|
| ST2 | 79 | 86.1% |
| MCD | 191 | 85.3% |
| TP53 | 72 | 83.3% |
| EZB | 296 | 81.8% |
| Unclassified | 177 | 80.8% |
| BN2 | 86 | 79.1% |

**Novel Insight**: BN2 subtype has lowest CR rate (79.1%), despite being considered "favorable" genetics. This may identify a subset needing alternative therapy.

## KEY FINDING 2: CNS Relapse is Catastrophic and Subtype-Specific

### Discovery (Duke, n=396)
**CNS relapse occurs in 12.1% of patients and is highly lethal**

**HR = 4.56 (95% CI: 3.15-6.60), p = 8.0e-16**

### CNS Relapse Rate by Subtype

| Subtype | N | CNS Relapse Rate |
|---------|---|-----------------|
| **MCD** | 82 | **18.3%** |
| **TP53** | 40 | **17.5%** |
| BN2 | 28 | 14.3% |
| EZB | 118 | 11.9% |
| ST2 | 37 | 8.1% |
| Unclassified | 91 | 5.5% |

**Novel Insight**: MCD and TP53 subtypes have ~3x higher CNS relapse rates than ST2/Unclassified. These patients may benefit from CNS prophylaxis.

---

## KEY FINDING 3: B Symptoms Associate with Specific Subtypes

### Discovery (Duke, n=910)
**B symptoms present in 36.9% and predict worse survival**

**HR = 1.38 (95% CI: 1.09-1.75), p = 0.007**

### B Symptoms by Subtype

| Subtype | N | B Symptoms Rate |
|---------|---|-----------------|
| TP53 | 76 | 47.4% |
| BN2 | 86 | 44.2% |
| ST2 | 78 | 42.3% |
| EZB | 300 | 37.7% |
| Unclassified | 178 | 36.0% |
| **MCD** | 192 | **27.1%** |

**Novel Insight**: MCD has the LOWEST B symptom rate despite having high CNS relapse. This suggests different dissemination mechanisms - MCD may spread silently to CNS without systemic symptoms.

---

## KEY FINDING 4: Testicular DLBCL is MCD-Enriched

### Discovery (Duke, n=442 males)
**Testicular involvement in 9% of male patients, heavily enriched in MCD**

| Subtype | N | Testicular Rate |
|---------|---|-----------------|
| **MCD** | 101 | **26.7%** |
| Unclassified | 74 | 8.1% |
| EZB | 146 | 3.4% |
| ST2 | 38 | 2.6% |
| BN2 | 41 | 2.4% |
| TP53 | 42 | 0% |

**Novel Insight**: MCD subtype has 8-10x higher testicular involvement than other subtypes. Combined with high CNS relapse, this suggests MCD has tropism for immune-privileged sites.

---

## KEY FINDING 5: Translocation Patterns Define Subtypes

### FISH Data (Duke, n=112 with FISH)

| Subtype | BCL2+ | BCL6+ | MYC+ | Double-Hit |
|---------|-------|-------|------|------------|
| ST2 | 44.4% | 22.2% | 22.2% | 22.2% |
| EZB | 39.6% | 22.9% | 14.6% | 10.4% |
| TP53 | 37.5% | 37.5% | 12.5% | 0% |
| Unclassified | 31.6% | 10.5% | 10.5% | 0% |
| BN2 | 14.3% | 28.6% | 0% | 0% |
| MCD | 9.5% | 23.8% | 0% | 0% |

**Novel Insights**:
1. **ST2 has highest double-hit rate (22.2%)** - may explain intermediate prognosis
2. **MCD and BN2 have NO MYC translocations** - pure mutation-driven
3. **TP53 has BCL6 enrichment (37.5%)** - may contribute to genomic instability

## KEY FINDING 6: IPI Components Have Variable Prognostic Power

### Individual IPI Component Effects (Duke)

| IPI Component | HR | P-value |
|---------------|-----|---------|
| ECOG Performance | 2.97 | 3.2e-16 |
| Age >60 | 2.30 | 1.3e-08 |
| Stage III-IV | 2.08 | 1.4e-06 |
| Elevated LDH | 1.95 | 2.7e-06 |
| Extranodal Sites >1 | 1.43 | 0.015 |

**Novel Insight**: ECOG performance status is the most prognostic IPI component (HR=2.97), stronger than age, stage, or LDH. This suggests functional status captures disease biology beyond anatomical staging.

### Mean IPI by Subtype

| Subtype | Mean IPI | High IPI (≥3) Rate |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| BN2 | 2.53 | 53.1% |
| TP53 | 2.40 | 45.6% |
| MCD | 2.28 | 45.1% |
| EZB | 2.26 | 44.0% |
| Unclassified | 2.12 | 42.1% |
| ST2 | 1.97 | 38.3% |

**Novel Insight**: BN2 has highest mean IPI (2.53) despite "favorable" genetics, explaining its lower CR rate.

## KEY FINDING 7: Stage-Specific Gene Expression (Lacy)

### Limited (I-II) vs Advanced (III-IV) Stage in GCB-DLBCL

**96 significantly differentially expressed probes (FDR < 0.1)**

Notable findings:
- **FOXO1 higher in Limited stage** - retention pathway transcription factor
- Multiple genes showing stage-specific expression patterns

**Novel Insight**: Early-stage GCB-DLBCL has distinct transcriptional profile, with higher expression of retention-associated genes like FOXO1. This supports the hypothesis that retention signaling keeps disease localized.

- Highest B symptom rate (47%)
- BCL6 enrichment (37.5%)
- **Genomic instability with aggressive dissemination**

### BN2 Subtype: Clinically Unfavorable Despite Genetics
- Highest mean IPI (2.53)
- Lowest CR rate (79%)
- No MYC translocations
- **Clinical presentation worse than genetic risk suggests**

### ST2 Subtype: Double-Hit Enriched

## CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS

1. **CNS Prophylaxis**: Consider for MCD and TP53 subtypes (>17% CNS relapse)

2. **Treatment Intensification**: BN2 despite "favorable" genetics has lower CR rate - may need intensified therapy

3. **Surveillance Strategy**: MCD patients may need more intensive CNS surveillance despite absence of B symptoms

4. **Prognostic Refinement**: ECOG performance status is most prognostic - consider weighting in risk models

5. **Testicular DLBCL**: Nearly always MCD subtype - treat accordingly

## SUMMARY

This broad exploratory analysis identified several novel clinical and biological findings beyond the egress pathway:

1. **Treatment response (CR vs not) is the strongest survival predictor** (HR=0.18)
2. **MCD subtype has unique tropism** for immune-privileged sites (CNS, testis) without B symptoms
3. **BN2 subtype is clinically unfavorable** despite favorable genetics (highest IPI, lowest CR)
4. **ECOG performance is most prognostic IPI component** (HR=2.97)
5. **ST2 has highest double-hit rate** (22%) explaining intermediate prognosis

These findings have direct clinical implications for risk stratification, prophylaxis decisions, and treatment planning.
