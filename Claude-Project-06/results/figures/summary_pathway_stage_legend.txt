Figure: S1P Pathway Mutations Associate with Disease Stage in DLBCL

(A) Late-stage disease rates in GCB-DLBCL stratified by EZB genetic subtype
(Schmitz et al., 2018, n=80). The EZB subtype, characterized by recurrent
mutations in GNA13, RHOA, and BCL2 translocations, showed significantly higher
rates of late-stage presentation (91.7%, 22/24) compared to non-EZB GCB cases
(60.7%, 34/56; OR=7.1, 95% CI: 1.57-32.3, p=0.007, Fisher's exact test).

(B) Late-stage disease rates in pan-DLBCL stratified by S1P pathway mutation
status (Duke et al., 2017, n=974). Patients were categorized by mutations in
retention pathway genes (GNA13, RHOA, S1PR2, P2RY8, ARHGEF1) or egress pathway
genes (GNAI2, CXCR4, S1PR1). Egress pathway mutations associated with
significantly higher late-stage rates (82.8%, 24/29) compared to patients
without pathway mutations (62.9%, 489/777; OR=2.83, p=0.03). Retention pathway
mutations showed no significant difference in this mixed-COO cohort (64.9%,
109/168; p=0.76), consistent with the GCB-restricted biology of these genes.
Dashed line indicates baseline (no pathway mutation). Error bars represent 95%
confidence intervals.

(C) Late-stage disease rates in GCB-DLBCL with sample-level mutation data
(DFCI 2018, n=21). This analysis includes direct mutation calls rather than
genetic subtype proxies. No significant difference was observed between
retention pathway mutants (40.0%, 4/10) and wild-type cases (45.5%, 5/11;
OR=0.80, p=1.00). Notably, no egress pathway mutations (GNAI2/CXCR4) were
identified in the GCB subset. The wide confidence intervals reflect severe
underpowering due to small sample size.

(D) Forest plot comparing odds ratios for late-stage disease across all three
cohorts. The retention pathway effect was significant only in the GCB-restricted
Schmitz analysis using EZB as a proxy (OR=7.12, p=0.007). The egress pathway
effect was detectable in pan-DLBCL (OR=2.83, p=0.03). The DFCI GCB analysis
was underpowered to detect effects (OR=0.80, 95% CI: 0.13-4.99). Filled circles
indicate p<0.05; open circles indicate non-significant associations.
Reference groups: non-EZB (Schmitz) and no pathway mutation (Duke, DFCI).

KEY FINDINGS:
1. The retention pathway (GNA13/RHOA) effect on late-stage disease is
   GCB-specific and diluted when analyzed in mixed-COO cohorts.
2. The egress pathway (GNAI2/CXCR4) shows significant association with
   late-stage disease even in pan-DLBCL.
3. Available GCB datasets with sample-level mutations are underpowered;
   larger cohorts or controlled access datasets (e.g., NCICCR-DLBCL via
   dbGaP phs001444) are needed for validation.
