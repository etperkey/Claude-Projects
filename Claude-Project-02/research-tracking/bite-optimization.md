# BiTE Therapy Optimization

**Status:** Planning
**Phase:** Literature Review
**Priority:** Medium
**Started:** TBD

---

## Hypothesis

BiTE efficacy is limited by T-cell exhaustion and the "antigen sink" effect from healthy B-cells expressing target antigens (CD19/CD20).

---

## Key Mechanisms Under Investigation

- The "Sink" Effect: Healthy CD19+/CD20+ B-cell reservoir
- T-Cell Exhaustion: PD-1↑, TIM-3↑, LAG-3↑, TOX+
- Model Selection: Humanized mice vs syngeneic systems
- Dosing optimization and cycling strategies

---

## Aims

### Aim 1: Characterize T-Cell Exhaustion Dynamics
**Status:** Planning

- [ ] Literature review on BiTE-induced exhaustion
- [ ] Define exhaustion marker panel
- [ ] Design longitudinal sampling strategy
- [ ] Identify optimal timepoints

### Aim 2: Model the Antigen Sink Effect
**Status:** Not Started

- [ ] Quantify healthy B-cell reservoir impact
- [ ] Compare humanized vs syngeneic models
- [ ] Develop mathematical model
- [ ] Validate predictions experimentally

### Aim 3: Optimize Combination Strategies
**Status:** Not Started

- [ ] Evaluate STING agonist combinations
- [ ] Test 4-1BB agonist synergy
- [ ] Optimize dosing cycles
- [ ] In vivo efficacy studies

---

## Current Tasks

- [ ] Complete literature review on T-cell exhaustion markers
- [ ] Identify key papers on BiTE resistance mechanisms
- [ ] Draft experimental design for Aim 1

---

## Next Milestone

Mouse model selection meeting

---

## Notes & Ideas

- Consider intermittent dosing to allow T-cell recovery
- Look into checkpoint combination timing
