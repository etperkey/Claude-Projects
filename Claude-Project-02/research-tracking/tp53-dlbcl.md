# TP53 Loss-of-Function in DLBCL

**Status:** Active
**Phase:** Experiments
**Priority:** High
**Started:** TBD

---

## Hypothesis

TP53 mutations actively remodel the immune microenvironment to create "cold" tumors that resist T-cell killing, primarily through MHC-I downregulation.

---

## Key Mechanisms Under Investigation

- MHC-I Downregulation (TAP1, ERAP1 suppression)
- Senescence & SASP Failure
- Aneuploidy & cGAS-STING Suppression
- TP53 Hotspots: R175, G245, R248, R273, R282

---

## Aims

### Aim 1: Define MHC-I Downregulation Mechanism
**Status:** In Progress

- [x] Literature review on TP53-MHC-I axis
- [x] Design CRISPR knockout guides
- [ ] Validate knockouts in cell lines
- [ ] Flow cytometry panel for MHC-I/TAP1/ERAP1
- [ ] Correlate with patient samples

### Aim 2: Characterize Immune Microenvironment
**Status:** Not Started

- [ ] Single-cell RNA-seq experimental design
- [ ] Identify T-cell exhaustion signatures
- [ ] Compare hot vs cold tumor profiles
- [ ] Validate findings in independent cohort

### Aim 3: Test Therapeutic Reactivation
**Status:** Not Started

- [ ] Screen epigenetic modifiers
- [ ] Test MHC-I restoration strategies
- [ ] Evaluate NK cell sensitivity
- [ ] In vivo validation

---

## Current Tasks

- [ ] Validate CRISPR knockouts in cell lines
- [ ] Schedule core facility for flow cytometry
- [ ] Order TAP1 antibodies

---

## Next Milestone

Core facility flow cytometry session

---

## Notes & Ideas

- Consider collaboration with immunology core for T-cell assays
- Look into published TP53 mutant DLBCL datasets
