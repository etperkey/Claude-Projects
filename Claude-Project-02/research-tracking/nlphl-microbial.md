# Microbial Drivers of NLPHL

**Status:** Planning
**Phase:** Hypothesis Development
**Priority:** Low
**Started:** TBD

---

## Hypothesis

Moraxella catarrhalis chronic antigenic stimulation drives NLPHL development, analogous to H. pylori in gastric MALT lymphoma.

---

## Key Mechanisms Under Investigation

- IgD BCR retention in LP "popcorn" cells (unique diagnostic feature)
- MID/Hag protein acts as superantigen for IgD BCRs
- Tfh rosetting provides survival signals (IL-4, IL-21, CD40L)
- Chronic antigen-driven proliferation model

---

## Aims

### Aim 1: Establish Microbial Association
**Status:** Planning

- [ ] Literature review on NLPHL pathogenesis
- [ ] Design epidemiological analysis
- [ ] Identify patient cohorts with microbial data
- [ ] Analyze Moraxella exposure history

### Aim 2: Validate IgD-MID Interaction
**Status:** Not Started

- [ ] Obtain MID/Hag protein reagents
- [ ] Test binding to NLPHL-derived BCRs
- [ ] Compare to control IgD BCRs
- [ ] Functional signaling assays

### Aim 3: Therapeutic Implications
**Status:** Not Started

- [ ] Design antibiotic intervention study
- [ ] Explore antigen-blocking strategies
- [ ] Identify early/relapsed NLPHL cohort
- [ ] Develop clinical trial framework

---

## Current Tasks

- [ ] Complete literature review on NLPHL IgD retention
- [ ] Identify collaborators with NLPHL patient cohorts
- [ ] Outline key experiments needed

---

## Next Milestone

Literature review complete, hypothesis refined

---

## Notes & Ideas

- Parallel to H. pylori eradication in MALT - could be paradigm-shifting
- Need to identify sites with NLPHL patient tissue available
- Consider retrospective analysis of antibiotic exposure
