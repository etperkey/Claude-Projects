## How to Use with Claude

Ask Claude to:
- **View status:** "What's the status of my research projects?"
- **Update tasks:** "Mark the CRISPR validation task as complete"
- **Add items:** "Add a new task to the BiTE project: order antibodies"
- **Summarize:** "What are my priorities this week?"
- **Plan:** "What should I focus on next for the TP53 project?"
