# Chemokine & G-Protein Mutations

**Status:** Active
**Phase:** Data Analysis
**Priority:** High
**Started:** TBD

---

## Hypothesis

S1PR2→Gα13→RhoA mutations disable the "confinement" signal in germinal center B-cells, enabling lymphoma dissemination.

---

## Key Mechanisms Under Investigation

- Retention Signal: S1PR2-Gα13-RhoA axis maintains round confinement
- Dissemination Signal: S1PR1/CXCR4-Rac1 promotes migration
- Dark-zone-locked, invasive phenotype from pathway loss
- Frequency: 15-30% of GC-derived DLBCLs (especially EZB subtype)

---

## Aims

### Aim 1: Map Pathway Mutations in DLBCL Cohorts
**Status:** In Progress

- [x] Identify mutation frequencies in published datasets
- [ ] Finalize S1PR2 expression analysis
- [ ] Correlate mutations with clinical outcomes
- [ ] Generate figures for publication

### Aim 2: Functional Validation
**Status:** Not Started

- [ ] CRISPR knockout of pathway components
- [ ] Migration and invasion assays
- [ ] Live imaging of GC dynamics
- [ ] Rescue experiments

### Aim 3: Therapeutic Targeting
**Status:** Not Started

- [ ] Test S1PR2 agonists
- [ ] Evaluate S1PR1 antagonists
- [ ] Assess GC confinement restoration
- [ ] In vivo efficacy

---

## Current Tasks

- [ ] Finalize S1PR2 expression analysis
- [ ] Draft figures for Aim 1
- [ ] Prepare data for lab meeting presentation

---

## Next Milestone

Draft figures for Aim 1 complete

---

## Notes & Ideas
