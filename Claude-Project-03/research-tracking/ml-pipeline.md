# Machine Learning Pipeline Project

## Overview

Building an end-to-end ML pipeline for automated data processing, model training, and deployment.

## Goals

- Reduce model deployment time by 50%
- Improve reproducibility of experiments
- Standardize data preprocessing workflows
- Enable automated hyperparameter tuning

## Key Components

### Data Preprocessing
- Data validation and quality checks
- Feature engineering automation
- Data versioning system

### Model Training
- Distributed training support
- Experiment tracking integration
- Automated hyperparameter search

### Deployment
- Model registry management
- A/B testing infrastructure
- Monitoring and alerting

## Progress Notes

- Initial dataset preparation complete
- Development environment configured
- Currently working on feature engineering module

## Resources

- MLflow for experiment tracking
- DVC for data versioning
- Kubernetes for deployment orchestration
